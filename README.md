# Secure-Sign-In-iPad

This is the iOS for iPad version of my Secure Sign In application, this project is currently not being updated because I have no iPad or Apple computer at this time.

This repository includes the Xcode project.

The logo and name on the application comes from an iWorks template, it is not a registered company name or logo, I just added it to make it look cool.
